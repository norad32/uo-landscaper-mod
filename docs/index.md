## About <a name = "about"></a>

The **UO Landscaper Mod** aims to enhance the Ultima Online mapping tool, UO Landscaper, by offering a complete and reliable collection of transition tables for all map tiles in the classic [Ultima Online](https://uo.com) (Time of Legends) client.

While this mod arrives fashionably about two decades too late, it serves as a testament to the lasting legacy of Ultima Online and its active Free Shard community.
